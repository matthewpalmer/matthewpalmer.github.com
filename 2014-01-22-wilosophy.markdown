Wil Anderson's latest podcast project *Wilosophy* ([iTunes]([itunes])) explores personal philosophies. Start with the oldest episode with Todd Sampson, who tells us about his childhood friends (murderers and murderees), his adult friends (Sir Edmund Hilary), and his success (CEO and TV Star).

Pretty inspirational.
