<h1>Practice Exam for Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Certification</h1>

<p>
    This post gives you five free practice questions for the CNCF 
    Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. These are 
    excerpted from the upgraded package of <a href="/kubernetes-app-developer/">my book for
    web application developers</a> getting their Kubernetes certification. 
    While not actual questions from the exam, these questions are of a similar 
    style and content to questions from the real exam.
</p>

<p>The <a href="/kubernetes-app-developer/">upgraded package of my book</a>
    contains a realistic three hour, thirty question practice exam
    with complete solutions. If you’re preparing to get your CKAD
    certification, I <em>highly</em> recommend purchasing this.
    (Many readers’ employers will cover the purchase cost.)</p>

<p>
    This premium exam contains more realistic, 
    more challenging questions and solutions that will test your ability
to work in an existing Kubernetes cluster under time constraints.</p>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<p>
    Create a namespace called ggckad-s0 in your cluster.<br/>
    Run the following pods in this namespace.<br/>
    
    <ol>
        <li>A pod called pod-a with a single container running the 
       <code>kubegoldenguide/simple-http-server</code> image</li>
        <li>A pod called pod-b that has one container running the
       <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image, and one container 
       running <code>nginx:1.7.9</code></li>
   </ol>

    Write down the output of <code>kubectl get pods</code> for the ggckad-s0 namespace.
</p>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
<p>All operations in this question should be performed in
the ggckad-s2 namespace.<br/>

Create a ConfigMap called app-config that contains the following
two entries:

<ul>
    <li>'connection_string' set to 'localhost:4096'</li>
    <li>'external_url' set to 'google.com'</li>
</ul>

Run a pod called question-two-pod with a single container running
the <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image, and expose these 
configuration settings as environment variables inside the container.
</p>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
<p>
    All operations in this question should be performed in
    the ggckad-s2 namespace.

    Create a pod that has two containers. Both containers should
    run the <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image. 
    The first container should run as user ID 1000, and the second 
    container with user ID 2000.

    Both containers should use file system group ID 3000.
</p>

<h2>Question 4</h2>
<p>
    All operations in this question should be performed in
    the ggckad-s4 namespace.

    This question will require you to create a pod that runs the
    image <code>kubegoldenguide/question-thirteen</code>. This image is in the main
    Docker repository at hub.docker.com.<br/><br/>

    This image is a web server that has a health endpoint served at '/health'.
    The web server listens on port 8000. (It runs Python’s SimpleHTTPServer.)
    It returns a 200 status code response when the application is healthy.
    The application typically takes sixty seconds to start.<br/><br/>
    Create a pod called question-13-pod to run this application, making sure
    to define liveness and readiness probes that use this health endpoint.
</p>

<h2>Question 5</h2>
<p>
    All operations in this question should be performed in
    the ggckad-s5 namespace.

    Create a file called question-5.yaml that declares a deployment
    in the ggckad-s5 namespace, with six replicas running the 
    <code>nginx:1.7.9</code> image.<br /><br />
    Each pod should have the label <code>app=revproxy</code>.
    The deployment should have the label <code>client=user</code>.
    Configure the deployment so that when the deployment is updated,
    the existing pods are killed off before new pods are created to
    replace them.
