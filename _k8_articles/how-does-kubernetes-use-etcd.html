<h1>How Does Kubernetes Use etcd?</h1>

<p>Kubernetes uses etcd to store all its data – its configuration data,
its state, and its metadata. Kubernetes is a distributed system,
so it needs a distributed data store like etcd. etcd lets any of the nodes
in the Kubernetes cluster read and write data.</p>

<blockquote>I’ve also expanded on this article in <a href="http://qr.ae/TUGAh4">this Quora answer</a>.</blockquote>

<h2>What is Kubernetes <em>really</em>?</h2>

<p>Kubernetes is a set of processes running on several machines.</p>

<p>(Actual, literal computer processes, not business-speak <em>processes</em>.)</p>

<p>One of these machines is the <em>master</em> and the rest are the <em>worker</em> nodes.</p>

<p><img src="etcd-diagram.png" alt="Diagram of Kubernetes cluster" /></p>

<p>These processes have a range of responsibilities, including</p>

<ul>
<li>handling API requests from kubectl</li>
<li>scheduling pods to run on worker nodes</li>
<li>runninng a pod on the worker node</li>
<li>monitoring and networking</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most of the code you’ve ever written… <strong>Kubernetes needs to store data somewhere</strong>.</p>

<p>That’s what <strong>etcd</strong> is for!</p>

<h2>What is etcd?</h2>

<p>Now, we know that Kubernetes is distributed – it runs on several machines
at the same time.</p>

<p>So, it needs a distributed database. One that runs on several machines at the same time. One that makes it easy to store data
across a cluster and watch for changes to that data.</p>

<p><strong>Kubernetes uses etcd as its database.</strong></p>

<p>The only nuance is that etcd is a distributed database – because Kubernetes is a distributed system.</p>

<p>etcd manages a lot of the tricky problems in running a distributed database – like
race conditions and networking – and saves Kubernetes from worrying about it.</p>

<h2>How does Kubernetes use etcd?</h2>

<p>Kubernetes uses etcd as a key-value database store. It stores the 
configuration of the Kubernetes cluster in etcd. </p>

<p>It also stores the <em>actual</em> state of the system and the <em>desired</em> state of the system
in etcd. </p>

<p>It then uses etcd’s <em>watch</em> functionality to monitor changes to either of these two things. If they diverge,
Kubernetes makes changes to reconcile the actual state and the desired state.</p>

<p><strong>A Kubernetes cluster stores all its data in etcd.</strong></p>

<p>Anything you might read from a <code>kubectl get xyz</code> command is stored in etcd.</p>

<p>Any change you make via <code>kubectl create</code> will cause an entry in etcd to be updated.</p>

<p>Any node crashing or process dying causes values in etcd to be changed.</p>

<p>The set of processes that make up Kubernetes use etcd to store data and
notify each other of changes.</p>
