excerpt: Brief rundown on my ios app...
---

<p>So I've done a <a href="http://matthewpalmer.tk/index.php/posts/learning-objective-c-and-ios">bit of learning</a> and I've decided it's time to step things up a bit. I'm going to make an iOS app. It won't be too complex - I'm sure any half decent developer could make it in a weekend - but it should be functional and useful enough to eventually put it on the app store. The app might be called DailyDo, and it will be a daily reminders application.</p><p>I want to build a daily reminder app because
<ol><li>&nbsp;1. The only daily reminder app on the App Store is horrible</li>
<li>&nbsp;2. It shouldn't be too hard</l1>
<li>&nbsp;3. There's lots of room for it to improve</li>
<li>&nbsp;4. It covers a lot of different aspects of iOS development</li>
<li>&nbsp;5. There are plenty of tutorials that will help me</li>
<li>&nbsp;6. I really need an app that does this well</li>
</p>
<p>I'm going to break up the work into a few sections in a feeble attempt to make things easier. I figure the smaller each section is, the less debugging I'll have to do at the end. Also, I'm trying to prevent having to make or implement any big decisions as long as possible, so that when I do I'll be as experienced as possible.</p>
<p>The whole thing will be done in a completely transparent, <a href="http://www.github.com/matthewpalmer/dailydo">open source</a> manner. I'll try to blog as much as possible with my progress, decision making and research. Hopefully this might prove to be an interesting read for first time app developers.</p><p>On <a href="http://www.github.com/matthewpalmer/dailydo">the Github repo</a>, I'll keep a list of todo items, sections, ideas, and code so you can follow along with my development process. The best place to check for updates is there, or you can <a href="http://www.twitter.com/p_almer">follow me on Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Oh, and I've done mockups of the app. Check them out <a href="http://d.pr/i/8mdz">here</a>.
