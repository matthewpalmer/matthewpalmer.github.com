Welcome.

This is going to be my new blog for the rest of 2013 (and hopefully into the future). I'm looking forward to hosting with Github pages because it's free, simple and they're a great bunch of people. Create a Github account if you haven't already. I'm going to be importing my old posts to the new blog system in the next few days, so if you see some strange things happen don't stress about it.

For those wondering, I've gone with a pretty standard configuration of:

- Jekyll with Github pages
- LESS style framework
- A local and remote repository (which are obviously managed through Git)

I'll write posts in iA Writer (in Markdown), commit them and push to the remote Github repo. This is by no means a revolutionary system, but it certainly beats the old blogging platform I was using. Plus, free hosting!

Let's hope I'm able to continue blogging like I was at the end of 2012, and less like the practically non-existent start of 2012.
