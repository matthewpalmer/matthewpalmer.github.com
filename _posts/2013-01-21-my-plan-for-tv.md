I'm a pretty big fan of good TV shows (as well as books), so through the next six months or so I'm going to do reviews and analyses of my favourite TV shows. I'll probably do _Mad Men_, _Breaking Bad_, _The Walking Dead_ and _Game of Thrones_. _Mad Men_ is probably the most technical of the shows, while _Breaking Bad_ is somewhat more engaging.

The plan is to analyse each show from a fundamental technical view; literary and visual techniques will be an important part of the posts. These will __not__ be reviews - there are too many of them and they are fairly uninteresting. I love exploring techniques, so that will take up the majority of the post. I may also include some character and plot analysis, but there won't be too much of that.

I might not doing all of the shows, but I definitely want to do _Mad Men_ and _Breaking Bad_. I can't wait for them to return.
