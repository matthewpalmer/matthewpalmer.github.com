title: What I Want in a Keyboard (i.e. someone kickstart this)

excerpt: Okay, hardware makers, listen. I've been looking around for a nice ergonomic keyboard recently, and none of them seem to fit exactly what I want. Even as I type this my fingers tingle atop the old Lenovo keyboard - frustrating. So, you should make this.

Okay, hardware makers, listen. I've been looking around for a nice ergonomic keyboard recently, and none of them seem to fit exactly what I want. Even as I type this my fingers tingle atop the old Lenovo keyboard - frustrating. So, you should make this.

- __ERGONOMIC LAYOUT__. In this case, the use of caps is me yelling at you. Something like the _Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000_ in shape, but without the Titanic structure.
- Comfortable. Fit yourself to my hands. Please.
- No numpad. I can't remember the last time I used a numpad; take it off. It adds like 1/5 of the size to the keyboard for very little gain. I don't care what you do with the PgUp/Dn/Insrt etc block, just get rid of the numpad.
- Not hideous design. The _4000_ is close in all regards bar this and size. Make it all black like a _Das Mechanical Keyboard_ I saw. No key letterings look awesome, but unfortunately  the Das looks like it would tear a whole in your hands through the combination of hand cramps and the reverberation of sound.

I'm probably going to get the _4000_, there aren't really any other good options. If you know of any good alternatives, my hands can't wait to hear about them on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/p_almer).
