The Google Epidemic

I'm writing this for the Google users who are in the same place as me: I like Google, I want to trust them, they provide great free services and they are everywhere, which is convenient.

Recently, I wanted to change the domain name associated with my Google Apps for Businesses account. I'm currently on the old free plan for Google Apps, which is being kindly continued by Google for now; I have no doubt that Google's current hospitality is short lived, and I believe that the same is true for all free services, even if the cost is not strictly financial. It turns out that it isn’t possible to change the domain name in any easy way, and the resultant data migration is not smooth. Mail, contacts and calendars are relatively easy to export from your account, but Google Docs - the important things - have to be done on a separate basis for each individual file.  It was a huge shock to be so blatantly locked into the Google Drive sphere; my documents are the most important data that I host with Google (email is a close second, but I put a lot less time into my emails than my documents). Google Chrome the worst of all the traps: give them access to your bookmarks and browsing history for a marginally better product (let’s not mention the Chromebook). I felt like a fool for not realising my mistake earlier.

In the above scenario, my entrapment was self manifested - the same is true for every Google user: if you are using Google services, __you are trapped__. I’m not going to pretend that I’m not in the exact same situation as you: right now, I’m writing this blog post in Google Drive because I prefer the writing environment. I use Google Apps for Businesses for email, calendars and contacts. I don’t even have an easily accessible local copy if my Google account stopped working. This is not okay; this is an illness.

Imagine if your Google account was locked out tonight. 

What would you lose? 

- The Google Docs stored in your local Google Drive cannot be opened: they are associated with a Google account (probably for security purposes).
- Any email which was not fetched by a desktop client would be gone.
- Any YouTube videos that you were hosting solely on YouTube.
- Any calendars which were not stored locally.
- Google Analytics data.
- Even more (link to screenshot).
- Your browsing history and bookmarks.

Say that you aren’t locked out. Even if it’s just a simple outage, you won’t be able to access anything that wasn’t already stored locally.

The all-encompassing Google presence provides an illusory sense of security: because Google is _everywhere_ and they host _all_ of your data, you somehow think that they care more, that they have your interests at heart, that they’ll have more than one copy of everything. But they don’t. You have all of your eggs in _their_ basket. And they’re going to sell your eggs. It’s worse than not having a backup of your data - you are trusting someone else, who realistically only cares about the data that they can monetise, to maintain your essential information. 

Google’s ever-presence is destroying our self-sufficiency; we no longer feel like we need to have our own copies of data because Google has it. It’s all there: up in the amorphous cloud upon which we rely. That sanctimonious cloud is not as white and pure and perfect as any cloud-based-service’s logos would have it seem - it’s dark, money-hungry and apathetic. Nevertheless, the cloud is always above us, and that’s _convenient_. Google is the king of convenience: they are everywhere, and everything they know about you is everywhere, just waiting for you to sign in. That’s a powerful and scary feature, but if you don’t have a backup (and Google sure as hell don’t) that’s in a non-Google format then you have a worse-than-zero redundancy, because Google only care if they lose some of the data in your account. Most of it is just kept to get you to keep up the flow of valuable information. Having everything with Google is the worst thing possible. Cloud storage and software is powerful and useful, but giving all of your data to one entity is irresponsible. Using Dropbox with non-proprietary file formats instead of Google Drive is responsible, but putting _all_ of your data inside Dropbox is not. And Dropbox makes money from you paying them for storage; Google’s revenue comes from abusing your data.

Right now, Google is coasting. In the same way that Amazon is controlling its profit (“The goal [of Amazon] is actually to not make a huge profit too early” - Siegler), Google is intentionally limiting its reach with ads. This is a company that knows everything about you; I truly believe that web-based companies know more about their users than any other kind of business. That’s because the users _volunteer_ their information. It’s not even unethical, because you consent to the total loss of privacy when you hit ‘I agree’ in the signup phase. Some obvious facts: Google is a company that makes money from targeted advertising; Google is a company that knows everything about you; Google is a company that needs to make money. The fact that Google doesn’t inundate you with perfectly targeted, insidiously introduced ads right now is because __they are coasting__. We don’t know when it will be, but eventually they are going to have to accelerate. And when that time comes, your data goes with them. They’ll introduce creepier ads, share your data with advertisers and do absolutely anything they want in order to make money. Google is a company that makes money from owning your data.

Being signed into Google is like having someone or something watching over your shoulder. If I came to your house, and said I would give you $5 a month to watch you use a computer, have access to your address, phone number, email address, emails, calendars, contacts, history and some files, would you do it? What is the price of your data, your files and your information? If you’ve got a Google account, you’re letting Google dictate that price for you.

Local backups are an important part of non-cloud based computer use, but they are of _greater_ importance when dealing with web-based software companies. Some people think it’s the other way around - they think that Google will look after them. Even if you ignore the fact that Google will, inevitably, monetise your data (and maybe you don’t care), ignoring the necessity of non-proprietary file formats and company-independent backups is foolish. This foolishness is a plague which has permeated modern computer use, and it needs to change.

If you’re reading this on Medium, Roon or some other non-www.palmer.im website, you’re probably wondering why I trust these services with my data. Answer: I don’t. But I own a local copy of this post (yes, I exported it from Google Drive) and they can’t take that from me. When you use Google Drive, Google can take it back. When you use Gmail without a desktop client, everything is gone when Google decides. I’m using Medium to distribute my content; I’m using the service and the service doesn’t own my data. With Google, that line is blurred.
