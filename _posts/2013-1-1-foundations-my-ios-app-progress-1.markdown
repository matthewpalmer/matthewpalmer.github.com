title: Foundations - My iOS App Progress #1
category: web

excerpt: A quick progress update on my iOS app's development.
---

<p>So I've been working on my <a href="http://matthewpalmer.tk/index.php/posts/my-first-ios-app">first iOS app</a> over the last few days, and I thought I'd do a quick update on the things I've been working on. You can check out the <a href="http://www.github.com/matthewpalmer/dailydo">Github repo</a> to see the future path for the app. It's a daily reminder app which helps you form better habits. Hopefully it'll be finished one day.</p><br/><p>I've been setting up the Github repo lately, and it's really a joy to do. Six months ago, I'd never used Github or version control of any kind, and now I couldn't live without it. I use it for as a backup service, for code stalking and as a manager for my project. Git, to me, seems kind of pointless without Github. Though maybe once I work on something substantial I'll change my mind. Good developers seems to love it - I guess there's a reason for that. You should really start using it if you haven't already.</p><br/><p>On the coding side, I've really just been getting the foundations set up. I'm going to use Core Data, it seems pretty awesome and easy to use. I wrote a <a href="http://matthewpalmer.tk/index.php/posts/dont-type-out-code-for-tutorial">blog post</a> on my somewhat alternative methods for learning about Core Data. There are a lot of good resources available for Core Data; definitely have a read through some things on the internet if you don't know much about it.</p><p>I've also been playing around with UITableViews, a staple of iOS programming. I'm really enjoying iOS programming, I love its verbosity and natural language methods and classes. I'd probably hate it without Xcode's autocompletion though. UITableViews are pretty easy to use, so there's not much to say here. I've separated the array/data class from the view controller, so I guess that makes for good MVC? I don't really know; I understand MVC, but I don't think I'm quite good at it yet.</p><br/><p>I'll try to keep these updates as frequent and as short as possible, so <a href="http://www.twitter.com/p_almer">follow me on Twitter</a> and I'll let you know when I post.
