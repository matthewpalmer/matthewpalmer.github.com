excerpt: I finished my app.
---

<p>I'm basically finished my iOS app. I have no motivation for working on it considering there's a much better app for what I want on the store and I can't even test on a device until I turn eighteen. The <a href="http://www.github.com/matthewpalmer/DailyDo">Github repo</a> has the latest version. You can look at it if you want.</p><p>The code is fairly awful, but I've learnt a lot. I no longer have a fear of creating an app from scratch, I know how to use Core Data and I know the value of modularising code (which I massively failed at). My next app is going to have much better, more efficient code. I just need an idea. </p>
