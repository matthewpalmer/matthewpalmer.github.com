excerpt: A quick write up about my second app idea...
---

<p>So I finished my first app the other week, and I can't do anything with it for another six months. I have no idea if it's worthwhile starting a new (more serious) project. I'd like to do something real time with a Node.js/Socket.io backend. That has a lot of server costs to it though. Think Cheddar-style stock market notifications. That would be pretty cool. A cross platform, real-time, dead simple stock market app. Clearly you wouldn't buy and sell from the app, but it would be a good way to monitor stocks. I've been using <a href="http://parse.com">Parse</a> a little and it's really awesome. You should check it out. The hardest part will be finding the realtime stock APIs to get the data from. I think the best ones are ones you pay for, and while I'd love to do that, it's not really on the cards. I've got a bit of research to do on the stock API basics. (Note to self: remember to look at SDStockKit by @stevederico).</p><br/><p>Anyway, in more concrete news, I spent a few hours making a  game that my brother wanted me to make. You know that game where you try to stop a stopwatch on one second exactly? It's like that. I can't release it or anything, so you might as well steal it <a href="https://github.com/matthewpalmer/TimerGame">from Github</a>. My first app is up there as well. I really can't wait for the day I can try these out on a phone. Six more months.</p>
