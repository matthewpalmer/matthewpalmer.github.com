title: I Don't Want to Pay Up Front for Your App
category: iOS

excerpt: In which I discuss the consequences of paid up front apps.
---

Being an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/second-stop/id669856150?mt=8">iOS developer</a>, albeit a new and amateur one, I understand the desire and the need for developers to make money from the things they make. I understand why apps cost the money they do, and the consequences of free, paid and in-app purchases for the developer and the reasons for doing so. While I can't speak for everyone my age, I feel that I am in the minority in this understanding.

__Despite my empathy for developers, I still don't want to pay for apps.__

In the case of apps, it's not because of the cost - it's the barrier. I research every purchase I make, regardless of price;  I have to look into reviews, screenshots and blog posts as to whether this piece of software is worth it. I don't know how many normal people do that in order to vindicate their decisions: most will see the price and opt for the free one. If I come across a few sub-standard reviews, a piece of UI I don't like or any other innocuous detail with which I do not agree, I won't buy the app. __By setting an up front price for your app, you're stopping people from trying it__, and moreover allowing them to feel justified in leaving one-star about the tiny particulars that they dislike - they paid money, after all.

If the app is free, I'll look at a screenshot and maybe the star rating on the reviews. That's it. There's zero barrier. It's not about the cost, it's about the purchase. With an in-app purchase, I already know what I'm getting - in this context by paying I'm going to receive more of what I already enjoy. With an up front paid app - I'm paying for the opportunity to try your app. 

To me, a great example of this is the case of Tweetbot vs Letterpress. <a href="http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/">Tweetbot</a> is $2.99, and is ostensibly the best Twitter experience on iOS devices. I know this; nevertheless, I persist with using the official Twitter client. It's free - I have to wonder: how much better can Tweetbot be? The answer: a lot better, but the up front price tag is stopping me from wanting to try it out. Now, consider <a href="http://www.atebits.com/letterpress/">Letterpress</a>, a free app which has in-app purchases to unlock themes and the ability to play more simultaneous games. __I didn't hesitate in downloading Letterpress, and I didn't hesitate in paying__ the in-app purchase price because I knew what I was getting and I knew it would be better. With in-app purchases, the user knows that paying will get them more of what they want; paid up front is buying some unknown quantity of an unknown product. The former, in most cases, has a much better degree of user experience. __The pricing on the up front purchase is completely intangible and arbitrary to the user.__

No part of the consumer in me __wants__ to pay for your app up front, but I don't mind doing it for an in-app purchase: I've gotten some value already, even if the upgrade isn't great.

Maybe it's because I'm cheap, but at least I know what I'm getting with the official Twitter client.
