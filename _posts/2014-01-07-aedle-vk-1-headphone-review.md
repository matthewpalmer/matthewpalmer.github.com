I've been watching these beautiful headphones for years, waiting for them to be more widely released and subsequently reviewed.

> This is the Aedle VK-1 and it is the only product the company makes. It is the singular vision of two men that has taken several years to reach fruition. Instead of being produced in a corner of a giant Far Eastern factory, they are instead made by a small group of workers in Brittany. 

Unfortunately the $550 AUD pricetag is a little high for me.
