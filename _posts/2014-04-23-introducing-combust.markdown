[Combust][1] is a social network I've been working on for the last few months. Posts on Combust disappear after six hours, and all your posts come in real time. You can see what people are writing before they even hit submit! I'm [@matt](http://combustapp.com/matt).

It's just been released into beta. I'm working on an iOS app too, which should be released around July. Try it out and let me know what you think.
