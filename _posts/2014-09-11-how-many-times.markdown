For all of yesterday's excitement about phones and watches—which, believe me, I'm caught up in—there's a little something missing from the buzz. There's this feeling that something's been forgotten, and we can't place it is.

Like maybe there's a translator speaking over Tim Cook for a quarter of the live stream.

The first thirty minutes of the keynote were punctured by the audio and video stream dropping out, the website going down, and two translators and the CEO in a duel to the death for the main audio channel.

The issue of the stream is so telling for a few reasons.

One: Apple has supposedly solved live streaming before. It streams events several times a year. This time wasn't just an exceptional load issue, and it wasn't just an audio or video glitch. The whole thing was broken, right from the jump.

Two: last week's news consisted of a stir around the insecurity of Apple's online services (these issues don't worry me about Apple Pay, though they do for the rest of iCloud). After a horrible week, you generally try to improve next time around. Unfortunate timing of unrelated issues—absolutely. But these occurrences are indicative of years of trends.

Three: Apple has never been good at services. iWork, iCloud, Maps, iMessage. At nothing in this list is Apple close to the best in the world. They've improved, sure. But slowly and sporadically. In their other divisions, Apple won't rest until it is number one. Nothing makes Apple want to be better than not being the best, unless you're talking about services.

Four: everything that Apple announced yesterday absolutely depends on services. The trend: Apple keeps piling weight on a horse that can't carry itself. Never has this problem been more salient than in yesterday's keynote.

Instead of optimistic questions about next year's watch, I have some hesitation. Some enquiries.

How many reasons do you need to make sure that the live stream of the biggest product event of the year isn't completely broken?

How many times does Apple have to get this wrong before it gets this right?
