Previously, I've kept stuff I want to do, which have a web resource component (think uni assignments), stored in Instapaper, only to be archived when the task is done. This isn't right. It ruined both Instapaper and my enthusiasm for the assignment.

This is not my todo list. My email inbox is not my todo list. My Instapaper queue is not my todo list.
