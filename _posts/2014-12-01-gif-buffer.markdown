For [Combust's](http://combustapp.com) new homepage, I wanted to display a gif. But I didn't want the gif to stutter or pause halfway through. I made and released [Gif Buffer](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/gif-buffer), a little library that switches an image for a gif once the gif is fully loaded.
