Some of [my favourite podcasts](http://atp.fm) record live, and I like to be able to listen live when I am able. They always announe that they're going live, but I'm not always on Twitter. I created and released [Monitor Twitter](https://github.com/matthewpalmer/monitor-twitter), a Node.js module for monitoring Twitter for tweets from a certain user matching a certain pattern.

The best thing about it is plugging it into another module—say, email or text messaging—to receive more convenient notifications for things I am interested in.
