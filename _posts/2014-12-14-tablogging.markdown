I've started doing something a bit weird. I've been calling it ['tablogging'](http://matthewpalmer.net/tablog/what.html), and it's what the name suggests: 
blogging whatever your open tabs are at the moment.

For [my tablog](http://matthewpalmer.net/tablog/), I'm using the following:
- Jekyll on Github Pages (with RSS)
- Safari extension
- Chrome extension

That's it. I love the simplicity of the setup once it's established. I can just click a button in my toolbar and 
it shares an update.

If you want me to publish my extensions, or a more detailed guide on how I'm using Jekyll, [let me know](http://twitter.com/_matthewpalmer). I have no idea if anyone else would be interested in this.
