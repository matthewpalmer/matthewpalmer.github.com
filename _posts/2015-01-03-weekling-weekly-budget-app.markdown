I just released a new update to [Weekling, my weekly budgeting app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/weekling-weekly-budget/id949338154?mt=8), and I realised I hadn't blogged about Weekling.

With Weekling, I aim to make budgeting as easy and simple as possible. My favourite feature is the ‘Input Grid’, which is a horizontally-scrolling grid of amounts you can choose from. This means you can enter an expense without typing a single letter! I also blogged about [using Swift Generators to create this gradient effect](http://matthewpalmer.net/blog/2014/12/09/swift-generators-colour-gradients).

In the next few weeks, I’d love to be able to add more features, including

- Today extension
- recurring expenses
- iPad version
- iCloud sync

I’d love if you [downloaded Weekling on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/weekling-weekly-budget/id949338154?mt=8)—it’s free.
