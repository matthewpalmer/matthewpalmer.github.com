I’ve just released a [new app called Charter](http://matthewpalmer.net/charter). It’s an iOS client for reading the Swift mailing lists. It’s available for free on the App Store.

From the app's website

> I shipped the 1.0 for Charter way earlier than I normally would, so the first version isn't that great. The good news is that work’s well underway for the next version.

I’m really looking forward to making this app better.
