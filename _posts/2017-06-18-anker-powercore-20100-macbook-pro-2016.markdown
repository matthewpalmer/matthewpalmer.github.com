I'm travelling around for a while, and I've been on the hunt for a good way to give my 13-inch 2016 MacBook Pro (Touch Bar edition) a bit of extra charge. There's information scattered around the internet on what works and what doesn't, and I wanted to collect it here so that you don't have to do as much research as I did.

The short story: the [Anker PowerCore+ 20100 with USB-C](http://amzn.to/2tB9pBg) is the best way to charge a 2016 MacBook Pro using an external battery pack.

There are some caveats, but the Anker is the best way that I've discovered.

* If you're using the laptop heavily while the Anker is plugged in, the laptop battery will still lose charge, but much more slowly than on battery alone
* If you're using the laptop lightly while the Anker, the battery level will stay the same or charge slightly
* If the laptop's sleeping, the battery will charge, but slower than the normal power adapter
* The 15-inch Pro is a different story because it has a) a larger screen, and b) different GPUs that draw more power. I expect that this means the 15-inch will lose charge under light usage while plugged in to the pack, but more slowly than without. I'd also expect that the laptop would charge while sleeping, although it will take longer
* My anecdotal data is back up by the specs. The 12-inch MacBook Adorable (which is referenced by the Anker page) has a [41.4-watt-hour battery with a 29W power adapter](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook/specs/). The 13-inch Pro gives [49.2-watt-hours with a 61W adapter](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro/specs/). The 15-inch Pro has a [76.0-watt-hour battery and a 87W adapter](https://www.apple.com/au/macbook-pro/specs/). The Anker PowerCore over USB-C gives 5V at 3A, i.e. 15W of output.
* The [Anker detailed specs page](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B014ZO46LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?_encoding=UTF8&*Version*=1&*entries*=0&portal-device-attributes=desktop&ref_=de_a_smtd&showDetailTechData=1&linkCode=ll1&tag=mattpalm-20&linkId=466bcca3bca761b1d17c61b8e825f0a7) mentions it's not "fully compatible" but I expect that this is just because it charges more slowly than most people would expect

Useful pages I discovered while researching:

* The [Anker PowerCore+ 20100 with USB-C](http://amzn.to/2tB9pBg) on Amazon, which has a lot of detailed specs
* [9to5mac](https://9to5mac.com/2015/11/16/review-anker-powecore-plus-20100/) reviewed the Anker with a MacBook Adorable
* [littleodie914's review of their new MacBook Pro](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/5a2kla/new_macbook_pro_13_my_thoughts_and_findings/) references the Anker
* [Powerbankguide's review of the Anker](http://www.powerbankguide.com/anker-powercore-20100-power-bank-review/)
