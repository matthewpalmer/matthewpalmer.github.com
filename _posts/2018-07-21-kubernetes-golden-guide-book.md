title: "My New Book on Kubernetes for Developers"
layout: post
category: kubernetes

I wrote a book! Itâ€™s a focused, clear introduction to Kubernetes for web developers. You can get the book from [Golden Guide to Kubernetes Application Development](https://matthewpalmer.net/kubernetes-app-developer/).

This post covers the behind-the-scenes of how I wrote the book. If you want to be sold on the bookâ€¦ click that link ðŸ‘†.

**Workspace**

Thereâ€™s a high table in the back left corner of the IKEA cafe thatâ€™s got this book written all over it.

Every time I start a new project, I seem to pick a new place to work from. For [Vanilla](https://matthewpalmer.net/blog/2017/06/13/vanilla-hide-mac-menu-bar-icons-free/index.html), that was a windowless room with sandstone wallsâ€¦ essentially a cave. Whatever place it is, it becomes forever associated with that project. All work must happen in that space, and once the project is done that space is tainted forever.

I highly recommend the IKEA cafe for a few reasons. (Iâ€™m putting faith in the fact that not too many people will read this and so the IKEA cafe wonâ€™t be ruined by crowds.)

* A tonne of space with no one side-eyeing you. The IKEA cafe is pretty much self-service, so you donâ€™t feel pressured to buy something every eleven minutes
* Solid wifi, access to power outlets
* Unlimited coffee for $2.50. Although I swear they ramp up the caffeine in the coffee so you donâ€™t want more than a cup.

A caveat: get the hell out of there before lunchtime. I had no idea there were so many families with kids in the world. And they all congregate in the IKEA cafe at 11:50am.

**Tools**

What does a programming nerd do when he writes a book? What about a programming *and* a Mac nerd? 

I really thought Iâ€™d get to write some interesting document generation codeâ€¦ maybe some hardcore LaTeXâ€¦ at least a script that did *something* to some Markdown.

I didnâ€™t get to do any of that! Whatâ€™s the point of that CS degree again? I just ended up using Pages and Keynote, and exporting to PDF. It wasâ€¦ too simple and easy.

Pages is decent. Keynoteâ€™s diagramming features are excellent. If I wrote another book, Iâ€™d probably use the same tools again.

The purchasing flow is handled by Gumroad. There are also some Zapier integrations Iâ€™ve created to generate notifications and give access to the upgraded package repo. The upgraded package is hosted on a private GitHub repo.

**Stats**

Some fun stats!

* 22,632 words
* 107 pages
* 16 diagrams
* 2k+ lines of sample code, solutions, and resources
* $621 first week sales

**Long Term**

Marketing-wise, this project is much more of a slow burn than my other apps. The current strategy is to write Kubernetes blog posts on commonly-asked questions regularly, and let Google do the rest. Iâ€™ll also experiment with answering StackOverflow and Quora questions.
