    description: I donâ€™t have a current picture right now but I recently or better finally ðŸ˜‰ switched from working on a 13â€œ Thinkpad to a 15â€œ Mac Book Pro. I loved the lightweight 13â€² laptop and I carried it everywhere around with me. But it was really bad for my eyes I guess and not really comfortable working long hours so Iâ€™m really happy with my Mac Book now.

    description: I always use a laptop stand (this one is called Griffin Elevator and I take the stand even with my while traveling), since I find it sooo much more comfortable for my neck. I use a wireless mouse and keyboard and my headset also has to be close by, since I need music to concentrate, especially if I work on theme code.

I try to make my work space as inspirational and comfortable as possible. So I love to have light colors and some creative things around me, like a notebook, inspirational design magazines, post cards and pictures and drawing materials (pencils, a notebook etc.).
