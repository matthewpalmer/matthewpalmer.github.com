    description: I try not to bring my laptop along to meetings so I can be more present in them; the laptop is then replaced with a small notebook and a Sharpie Pen. I've got an awful memory, and writing notes constantly helps me to better remember things.

    description: I rest my iPhone 5c on a handmade wooden stand during the day. I also keep a small $5 plastic watch handy when I need to keep track of time in a meeting but don't want to check my phone (like when I'm interviewing a candidate).

    description: I write everything for the book using Sublime Text and commit it to a Git repo provided by my book publisher. O'Reilly has a pretty sweet setup that takes the chapters in Asciidoc format and outputs them in both HTML and PDF versions so I can see how they'll render in the online and print versions of the book. Using Git for the book has been awesome; I can track plenty of the writing process this way and it's fun to watch the diffs as I go. The HTML version of the book also allows comments from my technical reviewers, which makes it much easier for me to consolidate feedback as it gets edited.
