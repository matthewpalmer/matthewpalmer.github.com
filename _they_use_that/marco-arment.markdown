    description: This is the best sound quality I’ve found that’s also practical in a home environment. This is my favorite microphone and the one I use, but its price keeps it from the top spot as a recommendation to others.

    description: Easily the best portable headphone I’ve ever heard, and one of the top few best headphones I’ve heard, open or closed, at any price, period.

    description: If you already use a split-ergonomic keyboard, especially the similarly curved Microsoft Natural 4000, it’s a huge upgrade that I feel comfortable recommending nearly unconditionally, as long as you don’t use the F1–F12 or Escape keys constantly.

    description: High-quality, solidly performing conical burr grinder. Rather than spend a lot on a fancy automatic coffee machine, you’ll get much better coffee with a good burr grinder and an inexpensive AeroPress, French press, or pour-over cone.
