    description: The Mini Vivaldi is one of the cheapest double boiler machines and works really well. (the one annoying thing is that La Spaziale has smaller group heads, 53mm vs the standard 58mm, which means I can't use VST precision baskets)

    description: There's a really great hack with the grinder, the next bigger (and better) model from Mazzer is the Super Jolly. You can take Super Jolly burrs and put them into the Mini, and you basically have the Super Jolly for much less money! (the only difference other than the burrs is that the Super Jolly has more motor power, which I don't care about)
