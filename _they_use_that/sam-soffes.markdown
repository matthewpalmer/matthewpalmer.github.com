    description: I ended up getting a pair of Beyerdynamic Custom One Pro since I liked my DT 770s so much. So far I'm a big fan. They only run $200. I didn't want to go overboard. My friend Bryn Jackson recommended PSB M4U, V-MODA M-100, and Master & Dynamic MH40 as well. They are all really solid choices, but I wanted to stick with Beyerdynamic and stay a bit on the cheaper side.
