        <h1>Practice Exam for Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) Certification</h1>

        <p>
            This post gives you five free practice questions for the CNCF 
            Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) exam. These are 
            excerpted from the upgraded package of <a href="/kubernetes-app-developer/">my book for
            web application developers</a> getting their Kubernetes certification. 
            While not actual questions from the exam, these questions are of a similar 
            style and content to questions from the real exam.
        </p>

        <p>The <a href="/kubernetes-app-developer/">upgraded package of my book</a>
            contains a realistic three hour, thirty question practice exam
            with complete solutions. If you‚Äôre preparing to get your CKAD
            certification, I <em>highly</em> recommend purchasing this.
            (Many readers‚Äô employers will cover the purchase cost.)</p>

        <p>
            This premium exam contains more realistic, 
            more challenging questions and solutions that will test your ability
        to work in an existing Kubernetes cluster under time constraints.</p>

        <h2>Question 1</h2>
        <p>
            Create a namespace called ggckad-s0 in your cluster.<br/>
            Run the following pods in this namespace.<br/>
            
            <ol>
                <li>A pod called pod-a with a single container running the 
               <code>kubegoldenguide/simple-http-server</code> image</li>
                <li>A pod called pod-b that has one container running the
               <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image, and one container 
               running <code>nginx:1.7.9</code></li>
           </ol>

            Write down the output of <code>kubectl get pods</code> for the ggckad-s0 namespace.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p>All operations in this question should be performed in
        the ggckad-s2 namespace.<br/>

        Create a ConfigMap called app-config that contains the following
        two entries:

        <ul>
            <li>'connection_string' set to 'localhost:4096'</li>
            <li>'external_url' set to 'google.com'</li>
        </ul>

        Run a pod called question-two-pod with a single container running
        the <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image, and expose these 
        configuration settings as environment variables inside the container.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 3</h2>
        <p>
            All operations in this question should be performed in
            the ggckad-s2 namespace.

            Create a pod that has two containers. Both containers should
            run the <code>kubegoldenguide/alpine-spin:1.0.0</code> image. 
            The first container should run as user ID 1000, and the second 
            container with user ID 2000.

            Both containers should use file system group ID 3000.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 4</h2>
        <p>
            All operations in this question should be performed in
            the ggckad-s4 namespace.

            This question will require you to create a pod that runs the
            image <code>kubegoldenguide/question-thirteen</code>. This image is in the main
            Docker repository at hub.docker.com.<br/><br/>

            This image is a web server that has a health endpoint served at '/health'.
            The web server listens on port 8000. (It runs Python‚Äôs SimpleHTTPServer.)
            It returns a 200 status code response when the application is healthy.
            The application typically takes sixty seconds to start.<br/><br/>
            Create a pod called question-13-pod to run this application, making sure
            to define liveness and readiness probes that use this health endpoint.
        </p>

        <h2>Question 5</h2>
        <p>
            All operations in this question should be performed in
            the ggckad-s5 namespace.

            Create a file called question-5.yaml that declares a deployment
            in the ggckad-s5 namespace, with six replicas running the 
            <code>nginx:1.7.9</code> image.<br /><br />
            Each pod should have the label <code>app=revproxy</code>.
            The deployment should have the label <code>client=user</code>.
            Configure the deployment so that when the deployment is updated,
            the existing pods are killed off before new pods are created to
            replace them.
        </p>
