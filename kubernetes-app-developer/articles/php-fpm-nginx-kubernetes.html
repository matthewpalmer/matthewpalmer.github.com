        <h1>PHP-FPM, Nginx, Kubernetes, and Docker</h1>

        <p>
            This is a guide to running Nginx and PHP-FPM on Kubernetes.
            You‚Äôll get an overview of each component in the environment,
            plus complete source code for running an application using
            PHP-FPM and Nginx on Kubernetes.
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>PHP-FPM</h3>
        <p>
            PHP is a scripting language used for web development. 
            CGI scripts are a way to run a script on the server when
            that server receives a HTTP request. Fast-CGI
            is an improvement on CGI which is‚Äîyep‚Äîfaster.
        </p>

        <p>
            PHP-FPM is an implementation of Fast-CGI for PHP with
            improved capabilities around process management, 
            logging, and high traffic situations.
        </p>

        <h3>Nginx</h3>
        <p>
            Nginx is a web server and reverse proxy that‚Äôs widely
            used for high traffic applications. When run in combination
            with PHP-FPM, Nginx is configured to send requests for .php
            routes to PHP-FPM to serve the page. 
        </p>

        <h3>Kubernetes and Docker</h3>
        <p>
            Kubernetes and Docker run our Nginx and PHP-FPM processes
            in a Kubernetes cluster. We‚Äôll create a Docker image
            that includes our application code, and configure a pod
            to run containers from that image in Kubernetes.
        </p>

        <h3>Together</h3>
        <p>
            In combination, Nginx serves web pages, passing requests for
            .php files to PHP-FPM. PHP-FPM takes the request from Nginx,
            handles dynamic processing of PHP, and gives the result back.
            Docker packages up our application, and Kubernetes makes sure
            it‚Äôs running.
        </p>

        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>
            PHP-FPM and Nginx need to have access to the same files on the
            filesystem. In Kubernetes, this means they need to be running
            on the same pod, and we‚Äôll use a volume to share files
            between the two containers.
        </p>

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: the PHP app</h3>
        <p>
            Create your PHP application. In this article, we‚Äôll use a simple
            hello world example. Create this file and call it <code>hello.php</code>.

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/matthewpalmer/d088a8e9a9a6c9076034db1bba9864b2.js"></script>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 2: the Dockerfile</h3>
        <p>
            Now create a Dockerfile based off the FPM variant of PHP, which is
            php:7.2-fpm for us. Copy your PHP source code into a directory in
            that Docker image.

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/matthewpalmer/bc5b2fb2119432911a412af29cb5a839.js"></script>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 3: the ConfigMap</h3>
        <p>Let‚Äôs get into Kubernetes-land. 
            
        <p>We‚Äôre going to have two containers running in the pod. 
            One runs PHP-FPM to handle dynamic PHP processing,
            and the other runs nginx to act as a web server. Both
            containers read from a shared volume.
            
        <p>We need to set up our configuration settings for the 
            nginx container we‚Äôll create.

        <p>Here, we tell nginx to send any request for a *.php file to our PHP-FPM
            application via localhost:9000.

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/matthewpalmer/c9c423d9409ef30e09e0eac07716387d.js"></script>
        </p>

        <h3>Step 4: the Pod</h3>
        <p>Finally, we can create the Kubernetes pod that runs our
            application container and the nginx web server sidecar.

        <p>Stop wasting time reading half-baked tutorials and terrible documentation.
        <p>
            I wrote <a href="/kubernetes-app-developer/">the #1 guide</a> for backend 
            developers to learn Kubernetes.

        <p>
            Great for people teaching themselves Kubernetes. Perfect
            for developers getting their CKAD certification.
