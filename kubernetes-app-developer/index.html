    <h2>The <em>Golden Guide</em> Difference</h2>
    <p>
      We think Golden Guides are better than your average technical book. How?

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Our Guides go through User Testing</strong>
          <br/>
          You’re familiar with the idea of ”User Testing” from software development. We do the same thing with our books to make sure they’re <em class="highlight">clear, concise, and practical</em>.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We teach theory three ways</strong>
          <br/>
          We aim to teach every theoretical concept in three formats—<em class="highlight">text, diagrams, and code</em>—to suit every learning style.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We teach with examples</strong>
          <br />
          Golden Guides include <em class="highlight">practical, real-world, annotated examples</em> and challenge exercises for every concept you learn.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We’re the Yellow Brick Road</strong>
          <br />
          Golden Guides have one ultimate goal: be the <em class="highlight">yellow brick road to achieving your technical learning goals</em>. We try to make your learning as smooth as possible, point out what’s important for you to understand and remember, and, most importantly, make sure you achieve your goal.
          <br />
        </li>
        <br/>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Every Golden Guide comes with our money-back guarantee. Achieve your goal or get a full refund, no questions asked.</strong>
