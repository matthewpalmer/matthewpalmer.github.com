    <h2>The <em>Golden Guide</em> Difference</h2>
    <p>
      We think <em>Golden Guides</em> are better than your average technical book. Why?

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Our Guides go through User Testing</strong>
          <br/>
          We take the idea of ”User Testing” from software development and apply it to our teaching. This process turns our books into clear, learn, and practical <em>Golden Guides</em>.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We teach theory three ways</strong>
          <br/>
          We aim to teach every theoretical concept in three formats—text, diagrams, and code—to suit every learning style.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We teach with examples</strong>
          <br />
          Golden Guides include practical, real-world, annotated examples and challenge exercises for every concept you learn.
        </li><br />
        <li><strong>We’re the Yellow Brick Road</strong>
          <br />
          Golden Guides have one ultimate goal: be the yellow brick road to achieving your technical learning goals. We try to make your learning as smooth as possible, point out what’s important for you to understand and remember, and, most importantly, make sure you achieve your goal.
          <br />
        </li>
        <br/>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Every Golden Guide comes with our money-back guarantee. Achieve your goal or get a full refund, no questions asked.</strong>
