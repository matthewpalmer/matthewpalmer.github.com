        <p>I took the test exactly two weeks after I started studying.  Your book was an integral part of my success. Thank you for writing it. The graphics are very helpful for visualizing what's going on.</p>

        <p>Thanks for this, Matthew - I feel far more prepared for the CKAD exam thanks to your book.</p>
        <p>The Linux Foundation's CKAD course was substandard by comparison.</p>

        <p>Originally went through the LFD259 Kubernetes for Developers training course and wasn’t quite satisfied with the preparation.</p>
        <p>I looked for more resources and stumbled upon this book and was very impressed.  Well organized and packed with clear information, I was more than happy to upgrade to the full package.</p>
        <p>
          I would highly recommend for anyone preparing for the CKAD exam or just looking for a solid reference for understanding Kubernetes.
