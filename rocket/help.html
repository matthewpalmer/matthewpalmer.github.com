      <h2>Trigger keys</h2>
      <p>Trigger keys, followed by the start of an emoji name, are used to activate Rocket. In the preferences window, a trigger key is written as a keyboard shortcut. For example, to use a colon (":") as a trigger key, the preferences window would show <code>⇧;</code>, left parenthesis ("(") would be <code>⇧9</code>, and so on.</p>
      <p>A word of warning: Rocket expects trigger keys to be a single letter that can be typed without using the Command or Option keys. Avoid using these keys when choosing your trigger key.</p>
      <h2>Adding custom gifs</h2>
      <p>Custom gifs and images can be added to Rocket once it has been licensed.</p>
      <p>Once you purchase Rocket, you will be emailed a link to download a collection of gifs. Download the zip file from the link.</p>
      <p>Extract the contents of the zip file</p>
      <p>Move the newly-created folder to a permanent location, for example in your Pictures folder. Rocket reads these files off your computer when operating.</p>
      <p>Open Rocket's preferences, click the tab for custom gifs, and click add. Locate the folder in the location you chose in the previous step.</p>
      <p>You can add multiple files to Rocket by shift-clicking on the first and last file to select all files in the folder.</p>
      <p>Click Add to add the files to Rocket's shortcut list</p>
      <p>Close the preferences window, your gifs should now be available.</p>
