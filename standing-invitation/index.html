title: Matthew Palmer – Standing Invitation

<div class="standing-invitation">
  <h2>G’day!</h2>
  <p>
    I have a standing invitation for you to email me 
    about anything that’s on your mind.
  </p>
  <p>
    My email address is <strong>matt@matthewpalmer.net</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I love helping people, answering questions, discussing ideas, and looking at
    work you’ve done. Anything from blog posts to open source code to poems.
    I’d like to see it!
  </p>

  <h3>Emails I Like Getting</h3>
  <p>
    There are a few areas where I might be particularly useful for you, generally
    at the intersection of development, product design, and marketing.

    <ul>
      <li>Your business, marketing, or tech strategy</li>
      <li>Mac, iOS, or Swift apps</li>
      <li>Web and JavaScript apps, particularly React and Node.js</li>
      <li>Kubernetes and Docker</li>
      <li>Building independent side-businesses</li>
      <li>Marketing tactics to grow your product</li>
      <li>Product design feedback (I’m more of a ”design is how it works” person than a pretty-buttons person.)
    </ul>

    Non-technical things I’d also love to talk to you about

    <ul>
      <li>Botanical gardens, plants, and parks</li>
      <li>Coffee and cooking</li>
      <li>Visiting Sydney? I have cafes to recommend. So. many. cafes. Also, let’s catch up for coffee.</li>
      <li>Books! I like getting book recommendations.</li>
    </ul>

    I’m also available for consulting engagements, but that’s probably not why you’re reading this. (If you are looking for a technically skilled software consultant who cares deeply about the business side of things, get in touch.)
  </p>

  <h3>The Deal</h3>
  <p>
    I have the unfortunate combination of a) being bad at email, and b) getting
    a reasonable amount of email. Let me set your expectations.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Will definitely get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You send me a personally written email about something that clearly matters to you</li>
      <li>You send me a direct and interesting email about something that I am well-suited to answer</li>
      <li>You want me to look at something you’ve made</li>
      <li>You ask for feedback on an idea</li>
      <li>You are looking for work</li>
      <li>You ask for a refund on a purchase. (It might be automated.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Will sometimes get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Vague or long-winded emails. Depends on busyness.</li>
      <li>You submit a bug report or piece of feedback</li>
      <li>You ask me to write some code for you</li>
      <li>You’re a recruiter (I’m not looking for work, but people who are looking tend to contact me, so I might introduce both of you.)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Will not get a response</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You’ve sent me a bulk email</li>
      <li>You’re asking me to participate in some survey (Github ”researchers”, I’m looking at you.)</li>
      <li>You ask me to vaguely fix something in my open source libraries</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important!</strong> If I don’t respond within a week, feel free to send a follow-up email. I probably just got busy on the day your email came through. If you follow up and ask me to reply, I’ll genuinely do my best to write you back.
  </p>
